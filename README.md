# CODE_DAE
This repo contains the files I developed while working in Dirección Académica de Economía (DAE-PUCP). 

In DAE-PUCP we do research on the Peruvian tertiary education system and labor market. As a research assisstan I took part in various projects, some of which are related to the following topics: 

* Recruitment strategy
* Admission analysis
* Demand for tertiary education in Peru and transition to higher education
* Educational segregation

Additional information:
DAE generates economic studies that contribute to a better economic management of the University and that allow making informed decisions, such as those related to the creation of institutional policies, and the creation of new programs, majors and units. It also evaluates their impact on the University's economy and budget. It also coordinates and manages the budgetary process and the formulation of the University's annual budget, and advises the units on relevant economic and financial issues, whenever requested.

The project began on august 2022.
